# AutoMeet

I'm creating this script to automate my online study in Google Meet. I'm too lazy to do that, but not lazy enough to create this script ;)

What already done:
- Input login credentials
- Login to account
- Choose class to connect according to schedule on each day
- Turn off mic and video in call
- Store timetable and schedule for each day and each week

 TODO:
 - [x] Replace all dumb time.sleep() with something smarter
 - [x] Change schedule every second week (medium priority)
 - [ ] Add auto disconnect from calls (high priority)
 - [ ] Make code more flexible for unusual cases (more work with elif)
 - [ ] Refactor function and variable names (low priority)
 - [ ] Create a global loop to switch to the next pair after leaving the conference
 - [ ] Implement launching from a server on a virtual machine running on Linux (more like concept)
 - [ ] Implement an interface in the Telegram bot (more like concept)

### Help and advices are welcome ;)
